D(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName, programAbbreviation, 
 courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity, 
 classification, grade, position)

-- a) Functional dependencies --

studentIdnr -> studentName login programName branchName
login -> studentIdnr
programName -> programAbbreviation 
courseCode -> courseName credits capacity departmentName
departmentName -> departmentAbbreviation
departmentAbbreviation -> departmentName
studentIdnr courseCode -> grade position
courseCode position -> studentIdnr 

-- b) BCNF schema --

Superkey
SK: programName: programAbbreviation
SK: studentIdnr: studentName login programName branchName
SK: departmentAbbreviation: departmentName
SK: courseCode: departmentAbbreviation courseName credits capacity
SK: studentIdnr courseCode: classification 
SK  studentIdnr courseCode: position grade

-- c) 4NF additions --
studentIdnr courseCode -> classification this (VIOLATION of 4NF) bc of courseCode ->>classification

R1(courseCode, classification) in 4NF 
R2(studentIdnr courseCode) in 4NF
