-- This file is used to run your whole database setup. It will:
-- * Delete the whole database (!)
-- * Run files that create tables, insert data, create views,
--   and later create triggers.
-- * Do any additional stuff you need, like testing views or triggers
-- You can and should modify this file as you progress in the assignment.

-- To connect to the database and manually run things
-- psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U postgres portal

-- Alternative, command to run this file (modify this if needed):
-- psql -f runsetup.sql
-- -U user -d database -f script.sql
-- psql -U postgres -d portal -f runsetup.sql
--psql -U postgres -d portal -f tables.sql

-- Life-hack: When working on a new view you can write it as a query
-- here (without creating a view) and when it works just add
-- CREATE VIEW and put it in views.sql


-- Tests various queries from the assignment,
-- uncomment these as you make progress
